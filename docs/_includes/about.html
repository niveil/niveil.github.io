                        <p class="text-faded text-left">Relatively new to the web development game, I decided to jump-start my 2nd career by attending 
                                                        the <a href="https://www.awesomeinc.org/bootcamp" target="_blank">Awesome Inc. Bootcamp</a>. This foundation developed my coding skills, provided an understanding of flow in my code, 
                                                        and taught me how to learn new languages/techniques quickly.</p>
                        <p class="text-faded text-left">I've since been honing my development skills, learning server management, and revisiting business analysis methods 
                                                        from earlier in my career.</p>
                        <p class="text-faded text-left">I moved to Lincoln, NE in 2020, and after a rough summer (moving in the middle of a pandemic makes it hard to meet 
                                                        people), I'm excited to experience and learn from the tech community here. </p>
