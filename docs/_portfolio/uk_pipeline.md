description: A feature on a College of Medicine Medical Education sub-domain that served as a companion piece to a brochure to help prospective students quickly navigate the summer medical camp application process. The challenge was to provide all information to prospective students while maintaining a relatively short page. Highlighted above is my solution built in Drupal 7 with a block plugin(PHP), custom CSS, and JavaScript to call the AJAX.
